# The effect of bearish markets on political choice in Ireland 
or this data project I am going to look at the relationship between GDP growth and the
turnout for elections. The idea of this project is to see if a change in GDP in the economy
will lead to a higher or lower turnout at an election. In its simplest form, do people care
about who is in power or representing their country when the economy is doing good, the
idea that if things are going well in the economy then a majority of people will also be doing
well and they will not care about who is in power. Or on the flip side, will citizens get more
involved and use their voices when the economy is doing bad in order to change
government and improve the GDP for the better so that they, as individuals will also do
better. This is working from the idea that people do not tend to care about something until
it starts to effect the individual negatively.
